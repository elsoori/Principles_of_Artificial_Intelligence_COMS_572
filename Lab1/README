Part 1
To run a particular algorithm on a txt file with the puzzle, enter the following in the terminal:
python3 cs572lab1.py ./Part2/S4.txt BFS

Part 2
To run all the algorithms on all puzzles in Part 2 you should enter the following in the terminal:
  	python3 lab1part3.py ./Part2 > Part2.txt

Part 3
To run all algorithm on all text files in a folder with the puzzle

To run all the algorithms on all files in L8:
python3 lab1part3.py ./Part3/L8

To run all the algorithms on all files in L15:
python3 lab1part3.py ./Part3/L15

To run all the algorithms on all files in L24:
python3 lab1part3.py ./Part3/L24

If you want to save results into a .txt file:
python3 lab1part3.py ./Part3/L8 > L8.txt
python3 lab1part3.py ./Part3/L15 > L15.txt
python3 lab1part3.py ./Part3/L24 > L24.txt
